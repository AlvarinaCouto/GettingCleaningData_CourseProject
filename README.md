**run_analysis.R** contains the code that does the following:          
1- Download and unzip the dataset https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip                
2- Merges the training and the test sets.                        
3- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.        
4- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.        
5- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.        
6- From the data set in previous step, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.        

**CodeBook.md** describes the variables, the data, and the work that was performed to clean up the data.        

**tidy.txt** is the desired output.
